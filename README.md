# Libft
Libft was my first project after the "Piscine".
It is my first own library in C. It reproduces the behavior of different C functions.
The purpose of this project is to re-code some libc functions, as well as other common utility functions to be reused in the subsequent 42 projects.

# Installation
Just download and execute make.
